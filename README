A tiny ruby rack application which exposes the data from facter as JSON over HTTP.

    gem install web-facter

Provides a simple command line tool which runs a built in web server. On accessing
the specified port you should get a JSON response containing the current facts.

    web-facter --help
    Usage: web-facter [options] ...

    Configuration options:
            --no-daemonize               Don't daemonize the web server process
        -p, --port PORT                  The port to run web-facter on
        -c, --config FILE                The file to load with configuration options
        -h, --help                       Display this screenp


You can configure web-facter using a configuration file, using the following format, and
specifying the filename with the --config option above.

    username=gilbert
    password=george
    port=3009
    daemonize=true
    filters="ec2_public_keys_0_openssh_key, ec2_userdata, sshdsakey, sshrsakey"

Note that the port and daemonize options will override those on the command line. The username and password options enable HTTP basic authentication using details specified.

The filters option will remove sensitive items from the output, you can specify any keys you like and they'll be remove automatically.

If you're using puppet (highly likely if you're using facter) then the provided puppet module might be of use. Include in your puppet module diretory and modify as needed. You can use like so:

    import "web-facter"
    class { "webfacter": username => "username", password => "password" }
